# TubeTV

![logo](./assets/images/icon.png)

A learning purpose mobile application built for personal use only. My father who used to watch news on youtube told me about the hassle of getting live News TV channels so I thought about to make a mobile application where all live news channels will be listed and searchable. Only react-native expo has been used to build with vanilla style.

## How to use
